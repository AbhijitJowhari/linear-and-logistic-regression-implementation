# linear-and-logistic-regression-implementation

This repository contains the implementation of linear and losgistic regression in python.

I have used a support vector classifier (SVC) with a linear kernel. However I have not implemented this 
from scratch.

I have Implemented logistic regression from scratch. The task is a classification task on the iris dataset.
